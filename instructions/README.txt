We’re excited to see how you solve our design challenge. We have supplied a Photoshop PSD, which contains the desktop view and mobile view. Additionally we have guidelines in the PSD, which mirror the Bootstrap grid column sizes. 

The PSD should be followed as close as possible, please pay attention to detail. 

Images can use placeholders (as in the comp) or you are welcome to use your own.

Please use a GIT based repository and share the url of your final work. We will pull from your repository to review your effort.

Frameworks to use:

Bootstrap 3

Google Font Open Sans

HighCharts:

Please note, this is NOT pass-fail – we are looking to see how you approach the breakdown of the design into a Bootstrap layout. If you don’t have experience working with any of this, don’t stress about it

Be creative. HAVE FUN with it
